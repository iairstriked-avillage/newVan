newVan is a continuation of https://github.com/jcrawl16/NetworkFlyout7. Made to work with Windows 11 version 24H2 and updated from .net 6 to 9.
This adds a few features including the ability to make a movable flyout. This only includes the Wi-Fi flyout, the issue on first time connect failures still apply.
